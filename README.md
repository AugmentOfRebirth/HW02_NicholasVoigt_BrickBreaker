Bracklynn Oat Breaker



On the title screen, you can click either Start or Exit, the former beginning the game 

and the later ending it (obviously)



use wasd to move back and forth with the paddle. You start with 5 lives. objective is to stay alive and keep going through the levels by destroying all the bricks.



There are two different level layouts chosen upon starting or getting to the next level, a "HI" layout and an "X" layout.



There are three types of bricks, orange ones are destroyed when the ball hits it, red ones spawn an orange one when they are hit,

and the green ones drop powerups. 



There are 3 powerups. the money gives you points, the arrows make the paddle faster, and the heart gives you an extra life

(unless you already have 5)



if the ball goes below the paddle you lose a life. when all lives are expended the game is over and you can choose

to try again or return to the main menu.
